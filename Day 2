String - 1. a string a *datatype* that represents a sequence of characters. 2. A string is *used* to store and manipulate test. Strings are inside "1" or ""2"" pairs of quotations. 3. Examples of operations strings are used for are : Concatenation(joining 2 strings together), Slicing(extracting a portion of a string). Strings are good for handeling ext-based information. Strings cons. Memory usage, Mutability, Performance in String Manipulation, Binary Data, Security
Integers - 1. An Integer is a *datatype* that represents whole numbers without fractional or decimal parts. 2. Integers are used to store and manipulate numerical values between whole numbers. The range of integers is dependant on the coding language and *type* of integer. Integers are used for tasks involving counting, indexing or performing arithmetic operations. Integers are good for counting elements in an array, iterating over a loop a specific number of times or storing numerical identifiers or quantities.
Float - 1. A floating point number is a *datatype* used to represent decimal numbers or numbers with fractional parts in programming. Floats are used in place Integers when more precision is required. Floats are commonly used in mathematical and scientific computation where decimal values need to be represented.
